          <app-brand-text [content]="'NEXT UP'"></app-brand-text> is a dynamic and competitive new game format that puts a spotlight on performing under pressure, especially when it’s your turn to go first off the tee. It’s all about stepping up when it matters most, defending your assigned holes, and seizing opportunities to gain an edge over your opponents.
        </p>

        <p class="relative">
          Here’s how it works: Each hole is a chance to earn points. A golfer earns 3 points for successfully defending a hole when they’re first off the tee, while their opponent can earn 1 point if they manage to beat the defender. The game keeps things fair and exciting by randomising who tees off first across the round, ensuring everyone gets their share of opportunities to defend.

        <p class="relative">
          But that’s not all—<app-brand-text [content]="'NEXT UP'"></app-brand-text> has a clever comeback mechanic. Any remaining unassigned holes are given to the golfer with the lowest score at the time of tee-off. This creates a unique opportunity for the trailing player to defend the hole, potentially swinging momentum back in their favor and leveling the playing field.
        </p>
