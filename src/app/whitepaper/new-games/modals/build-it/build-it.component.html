          Here’s how it works: Players form teams and compete against other teams, building a combined scorecard using their lowest individual scores. This collaborative approach ensures that every contribution matters, while also encouraging teammates to push each other to perform their best. The format is entirely flexible, letting golfers decide how long the competition runs—whether it’s a single round, a weeklong event, or even an epic season that stretches across an entire year.
